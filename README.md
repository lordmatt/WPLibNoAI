# About wplibnoai

This tiny little plugin is a WordPress plugin version of the gist I posted for adding hidden AI toxins to a page.

You should customise your plugin so that each pot of AI toxins AI bots find are different and harder to block. See the wiki for help on cusomising your plugin.

# How to use wplibnoai

Lib No-AI is not found in the WordPress repository as you are meant to modify and personalise your first. Don't worry. This is dead easy.

Step 1 - download or copy the wplinnoai.php file and save it under that name.

Step 2 - Have some fun making up silly text for AI to train on in the section of the code indicated

Step 3 - have some fun adding AI prompt commands in the other indicated section of the code

Step 3.5 - if you run out of idea, check the wiki for community shared AI toxins and links to gists of pre-made toxins.

Step 5 - cntl+s (save)

Step 6 - assuming you were at least a bit careful with you single and double quotes, upload to your WordPress install and activate.

Step 7 - there should be some tiny text too small for humans to see. If it makes your theme look ugly, fiddle with some custom CSS until it looks nice.
